Nobody is questioning this at the moment, in general people are happy that communism is over and that Nikolai is saying that he will take care of his people and that they will be richer than before. But the other information we have heard is that he is very angry and he's burning to take revenge on Germany and its allies. Let's hope he doesn't make the wrong moves that will put our country in a bad situation again and make history repeat itself."

POLITICS_IOSIF_STALIN_DESC:0 "Stalin, also known as Vojd, is the ruler of the Soviet Union, the man who overthrew Trotsky, the heir of Lenin, the protector of the Russian nation.\nTrotsky was called the next leader after Lenin, as well as being in a strong position within the party with the effect of the War Commissariat he was carrying out. However, thanks to some mistakes made by him and Stalin's clever policies, he lost power. After Lenin's death, Stalin's popularity also increased among the public with his speeches on the radio and his writings in newspapers. In this process, Stalin allied himself with Bukharin and acted against Kamelev and Zinoviev. Trotsky was first removed from the Politburo in 1926 and then from the party's Central Committee in 1927 together with Zinoviev.\nAfter Lenin's death, Stalin took an active role in the elaboration and implementation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union policy, economic and cultural development plans, measures to strengthen the country's defense capability, and the foreign policy practices of the party and the Soviet government. Along with other prominent Party leaders, Stalin waged an uncompromising struggle against the opponents of Leninism.\nHe played an important role in the ideological and political defeat of Trotskyism and right-wing opportunism, in defending the doctrine of Leninism for the victory of socialism in the USSR, and in consolidating the unity of the Party."
