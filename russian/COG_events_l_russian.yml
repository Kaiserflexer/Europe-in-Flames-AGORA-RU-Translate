The town was connected by the river and a few sand tracks that could be travelled by porters. Europeans were everywhere.  The locals usually worked as porters or boatmen. Ryckmans first visited the administrative building, where he was welcomed. Together with the mayor and a few journalists, they set off on their way. They came to a bridge over the Kasai River, which was built in 1935. Ryckmans asked why the bridge had been under construction for so long.  The mayor said, "Sir, we are certainly trying to keep the construction going as fast as possible, but the Kitawalas are sabotaging our work." Ryckmans said..."

 congo_dem.1.t:0 "The Belgian Governor-General is dead"
 congo_dem.1.d:0 "In 1936, the Belgian Governor-General of the Congo, Pierre Ryckmans, was assassinated. The death of the Governor-General upset the political and social balance of the Congo, and anxiety and uncertainty spread throughout the country.\n\nThe Belgian government and Congolese local authorities began to discuss what action to take in the aftermath. Belgians living in Congo demanded more protection from the government and security forces. And the Congolese people began to press for justice and for the forces behind the assassination to be uncovered. Local leaders in other colonies closely monitored events in the Congo and attempted to ensure their own security.\n\nThe international community was also keeping a close eye on the situation. The murder of Ryckmans demonstrated the growing political instability in the Congo and security threats in Belgium's colonies. This led to a questioning of European colonial policies and further debate on the future of colonies like the Congo.\n\nAs a result, Ryckmans' assassination had a profound impact on the Congo colony. In the aftermath, it became clear that political leaders and the international community have a serious responsibility to take steps to stabilize the region and prevent similar events from recurring.\n\n What should we do?"
 congo_dem.1.a:0 "Send a another governor"
 congo_dem.2.t:0 "New Governor Arrived"
 congo_dem.2.d:0 "When the announcement was made after the last meeting of the Belgian Colonial Ministry, announcing the appointment of Louwers as the new Governor General, there was both excitement and uncertainty in Congo. With Louwers' appointment, many questions about the future of the Congo began to arise. Shaken by the death of Ryckmans, it was a matter of curiosity what kind of transformation Congo would undergo under Louwers' leadership.\n\nIn 1936, the Congo's hot and humid weather awaited the arrival of the newly appointed Belgian Governor-General, Octave Louwers. Louwers had been appointed to replace the previous Governor-General, Pierre Ryckmans, and as the new leader of the Congo, he faced a huge responsibility.\n\nUpon Louwers' arrival, a grand welcoming ceremony was organized in the Congolese capital, Leopoldville. Local people took to the streets to welcome the new Governor General and greeted him with traditional dances and music. However, Louwers' first challenge was to gain the trust of the people and the administration. Following Ryckmans, Louwers had to understand Congo's complex political and social structure and move quickly to meet the expectations of the people.\n\nMeanwhile, other European powers were closely watching what was happening in the Congo. How Belgium's influence in the Congo would change under Louwers' leadership and the impact of this change on the other powers in the region was a matter of great interest.\n\nWith Louwers' arrival, a new chapter in Congo's history had begun. However, following the events of the past, the future of Congo was uncertain, and how Louwers' leadership would manage this uncertainty was an important question for the Congolese people and the international community."
 congo_dem.2.a:0 "Welcome, new Governor!"
 congo_dem.3.t:0 "Political Emancipation"
 congo_dem.3.d:0 "Following recent events, the Belgian government announced that it would review its policies in the Congo. At the same time, it announced that King Pierre of Belgium could now be considered a nobleman, i.e. worthy of the title of Graaf, even in death. These announcements were perceived as harbingers of a political transformation in the Congo and were closely watched by both the local population and the international community.\n\nThe new administration, led by Octave Louwers, began to make radical changes to Congo's political and social structure. Louwers approved a law that allowed people to travel freely between cities. This law allowed people living in different parts of Congo to live freer and more independent lives.\n\nThe new law has increased the mobility of Congolese people from all over Congo. People could now travel more freely between cities for work, study or family visits. This encouraged cultural exchange and economic interaction between different regions of Congo.\n\nWith this new freedom, Congolese people had the opportunity to shape their own lives. Some migrated to different cities in search of new opportunities, while others returned to their places of birth to connect more firmly to their roots. However, this transformation has not been without its challenges. The new wave of migration has led to infrastructure problems and population growth in some cities, posing new challenges for local authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, the review of Belgian policies in the Congo had profound effects on the political and social balance in the region. The Congolese people now demanded more freedom and justice, while the international community began to question Belgium's colonial policies. This marked the beginning of an era that promises more debate and change for Congo's future."
 congo_dem.3.a:0 "Carpe diem!"
 congo_dem.4.t:0 "Found of ABAKO"
 congo_dem.4.d:0 "Congolese intellectuals of Congolese origin who returned to Congo founded the Bakongo Alliance or ABAKO, a political organization nowadays led by a priest named Daniel Kanza. This organization aimed to liberate Congo from all foreign powers as soon as possible. After ABAKO's manifesto was published, its members were released from prison a few hours later, as they had committed no legal offense.\n\nHowever, ABAKO's founding and goals had a major impact in the Congo. Under Kanza's leadership, the organization raised the demands of the Congolese people for freedom and independence. Other political groups in Congo joined ABAKO's call and decided to fight together against foreign domination of the people.\n\nFollowing ABAKO's manifesto, protests began outside police stations across Congo. People took to the streets to demand justice, demanding the release of ABAKO members. These protests spread to different parts of Congo, sending a signal to the government to take heed.\n\nHowever, as unrest grew in Congo, the Belgian government and colonial authorities became concerned. The rising power of ABAKO and Kanza's leadership began to question Belgium's control over Congo. The government began to take strict measures to detain ABAKO members and supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, other political groups and communities in Congo began to raise their voices. The emergence of ABAKO was recognized as a harbinger of a significant change in Congo's political and social atmosphere. The growing demands against Belgian domination were seen as an important turning point that would determine the future of Congo."
 congo_dem.4.a:0 "It's gonna get worse."
 congo_dem.5.t:0 "Questions of Congo"
 congo_dem.5.d:0 "Belgian control over the Congo had existed in whole or in part since the founding of the International African Association. However, from the early 1900s onwards, nationalist ideologies became increasingly influential in the Congo and the population gradually began to forget that they were being liberated. This led many scholars to publish articles on the subject.\n\nThe general consensus is that Belgium should gradually withdraw from Congo in a 10-year program. The Belgian Colonial Ministry has begun to discuss this issue. On the table was the Casement Report, a document about the famine and deaths in the Congo caused by the reforms of the powerful and haughty King Leopold gone wrong. This document was a huge fiasco when it was first published. The League of Nations stated that if this happened again, it would take over the Congo by force.\n\nAware of the situation, Octave Louwers presented a rapid withdrawal plan to the Colonial Ministry. According to this plan, the Congo would become a semi-independent union. This plan was seen as a way of responding to international pressure by reducing Belgian dominance in the Congo and giving the region more freedom.\n\nHowever, Louwers' proposal was controversial. Some felt that it was not radical enough for Congo's future and demanded full independence. Others felt that the Belgian withdrawal plan could jeopardize Congo's political and economic stability.\n\nMeanwhile, the rise of political organizations in Congo, such as ABAKO, and growing popular demands made it clear that Belgium needed to reconsider its Congo policy. Louwers' plan only deepened the debate and uncertainty over Congo's future."
 congo_dem.5.a:0 "Pass the bill"
 congo_dem.5.b:0 "These are OUR lands"
 congo_dem.6.t:0 "Bill is passed"
 congo_dem.6.d:0 "The law sent by Octave Louwers was passed and the Congo would no longer be a colony of Belgium, but a mandate. Also, the Belgian king would still be the king of the Congo. After the declaration of the union, the former governors were appointed as temporary deputies and Octave Louwers was elected president after a emergency vote.\n\nThis decision caused great excitement in the Congo. The population saw it as a sign of growing resistance to long-standing Belgian domination. However, the fact that the Congo was now a mandate meant that some still wanted full independence. The new administration under Louwers' leadership was celebrated as representing the beginning of Congo's journey to independence, but the fact that it was still not fully independent worried some.\n\nUnder Louwers' presidency, major changes in Congo's political and economic structure looked set to begin. With popular participation and involvement, important steps were taken towards Congolese self-determination. However, the fact that Leopold was still the king of the Congo was still seen by some as a sign of dependence on an outside power.\n\nThe new administration, led by Louwers, promised to strive for Congo's modernization and development. As promised, it immediately started to do so. However, political and social problems were still to be resolved."
 congo_dem.6.a:0 "Long Live the King?"
 congo_dem.6.b:0 "This is f*cking absurdité!"
 congo_dem.7.t:0 "Bill is denied"
 congo_dem.7.d:0 "The law sent by Octave Louwers was rejected by the Belgian Colonial Ministry. The Ministry rejected this law because it stated that the Belgian king would remain king of the Congo. Following the rejection, Octave Louwers resigned and the Colonial Ministry appointed Eugène Jungers as the new governor. Louwers was reportedly on his way to explain this situation to the United Kingdom.\n\nLouwers' resignation and the appointment of Jungers caused great consternation in Congo. The people saw that the changes that had begun with hope under Louwers' leadership now faced an uncertain future. This led to growing discontent and opposition to Belgian rule in the Congo.\n\nLouwers' visit to the United Kingdom was a sign of Congo's efforts to seek international support. The United Kingdom was willing to support the Congo's struggle for independence, and Louwers' personal visit could be seen as part of an effort to question Belgium's Congolese policies on an international platform.\n\nHowever, there was a huge backlash among the Congolese people against Louwers' resignation and Jungers' appointment. In particular, the end of the reforms and changes initiated under Louwers' leadership caused frustration among the population. However, the political atmosphere in the Congo became increasingly tense and there was more resistance to Belgian domination of the Congo.\n\nThe appointment of Eugène Jungers to the Congo was likely to further challenge the political and social balance in the Congo. Under Jungers' leadership, there were fears that Belgian policies in the Congo could become more hardline and popular discontent could grow. Louwers' departure to the United Kingdom added to the uncertainty of Congo's future."

His gaze traveled over the councillors, feeling the tension on each of their faces.\n\nThe fire of independence burned in his heart and he was determined to spread it to every corner of the assembly "Congolese!" Louwers cried, his voice echoing in the hall. "We are gathered here today to decide our destiny. It is time to break the chains of bondage and rise as a free nation!" In an enthusiastic voice, Louwers described Congo's riches and potential. "Our land is fertile, our people are hardworking and intelligent. We are not inferior to any nation! We have the right to self-determination and self-government!"The idea of independence was not new in parliament. But Louwers' words resonated in the hearts of the assembly members. His passion and conviction were contagious. "We will no longer live under the yoke of the colonizers!" he cried. "Congo will be independent!" Louwers peppered his speech with historical examples. "Remember the struggle for independence of the United States of America!" he told the assembly members. "Remember the principles of freedom and equality brought by the French Revolution! Like them, we can win our independence and build our own nation!"\n\nWhen the speech was over, the councillors gave him a standing ovation. Louwers' words had set their hearts on fire. The desire for independence was stronger than ever."

 congo_dem.9.d:0 "The long-awaited election day finally arrived in the Congo, marking a historic moment in the nation's journey towards democracy. Despite challenges such as bad weather and personal illnesses, men and women from all walks of life across the country showed up at the designated voting booths in their respective provinces to cast their votes for their preferred party or candidate. The sheer magnitude of voter turnout took many by surprise, especially considering the rapid transition to democracy that the country was undergoing.\n\nThe atmosphere on election day was electric, with anticipation and excitement palpable in the air. For many Congolese citizens, this was their first opportunity to participate in a free and fair election, a fundamental right that had long been denied to them. Despite the lingering uncertainties and tensions surrounding the political landscape, the overwhelming desire for change and progress propelled people to exercise their democratic rights with fervor and determination.\n\nAs the voting process unfolded throughout the day, it became evident that the electoral race was fiercely contested. Political parties and candidates campaigned vigorously, each vying for the support of the electorate. While the election was not without its flaws and controversies, including allegations of voter intimidation and irregularities, the resilience and spirit of the Congolese people shone through as they stood firm in their commitment to shaping the future of their nation through peaceful and democratic means.\n\nThe aftermath of the election saw a flurry of activity as ballots were meticulously counted and results tallied. It was a painstaking process that required careful scrutiny and attention to detail. As the hours turned into days, the suspense only grew, with the entire country eagerly awaiting the announcement of the final outcome.\n\nFinally, after much anticipation, the final winners of Congo's first free election were announced. The results reflected the diverse aspirations and voices of the Congolese people, showcasing a democratic triumph in the face of adversity. While the road ahead remained challenging and uncertain, the successful conduct of the election served as a beacon of hope for a brighter and more inclusive future for the Congo and its citizens.\n\nThe final winners of Congo's first election..."

congo_escape.1.d:0 "The telegram from Congo sent shockwaves across the international community, drawing attention to the deep-seated grievances and injustices endured by the Congolese people under Belgian colonial rule. The message, signed by Madam Ngalifourou, echoed the sentiments of countless individuals who had long suffered under the oppressive yoke of colonial exploitation and brutality:\n\n''Congo sends this telegram to express the persecution and injustices suffered under Belgian colonial rule. We are fed up with the inhuman treatment and exploitation of the Congolese people by the Belgian colonialists.''\n\n''We ask the Government of France to seize this historic opportunity and protect Congo.''\n\nMadame Ngalifourou\n\nIn response to this plea for protection, the French government found itself facing a pivotal moment in its colonial policy. The opportunity to extend support to Congo presented a unique chance to expand French influence in the region while also championing the cause of decolonization and human rights. However, it also posed significant diplomatic challenges, particularly given the delicate balance of power in colonial Africa and the potential for backlash from Belgium and other colonial powers.\n\nAs the telegram reverberated through diplomatic circles, discussions and debates ensued within the French government regarding the best course of action. Some advocated for a swift and decisive response, arguing that France had a moral obligation to come to the aid of its fellow Africans in their struggle for freedom and dignity. Others urged caution, citing the complex geopolitical dynamics at play and the potential repercussions of intervening in Belgium's sphere of influence.\n\nMeanwhile, in Congo, the reception to the telegram was mixed. While many hailed it as a bold and courageous move to seek liberation from colonial oppression, others expressed concerns about the uncertain path that lay ahead. The prospect of aligning with France brought both hope and apprehension, as the Congolese people grappled with the uncertainties of what the future might hold."

If realized, this plan would position Congo as one of the largest countries in Africa, with significant political and economic influence over its neighbors.\n\nThe Congolese government defended its expansionist agenda, arguing that it was motivated by a desire for regional peace and stability rather than imperialist ambitions. Officials maintained that the peoples of Equatorial Africa expressed a genuine desire to join Congo and that the plan was driven by their collective will, rather than imposed colonialism.\n\nHowever, France and other countries remained skeptical of Congo's intentions, fearing that the proposed annexation of French colonies was a thinly veiled attempt to extend Congo's control over the region. Critics argued that Congo's expansionist aspirations threatened to disrupt the delicate balance of power in Equatorial Africa, potentially fueling instability and conflict.\n\nThe escalating tensions prompted urgent diplomatic negotiations and behind-the-scenes maneuvering as countries scrambled to protect their interests and safeguard regional stability.
