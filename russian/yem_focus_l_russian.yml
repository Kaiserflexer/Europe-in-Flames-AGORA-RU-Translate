#Army

YEM_muzaffer_army_desc:0 "After the Ottoman Empire had abandoned Yemen, even the soldiers recruited by Imam Yahya in his call for jihad had become insufficient.

YEM_expand_royal_guards:0 "Expand Royal Guards"

After the 1926 law of the Kingdom, the Ukfa troops began to undertake other tasks besides protecting the Imam..."
YEM_further_arming_the_tribal_army:0 "Further Arming the Tribal Army"
YEM_further_arming_the_tribal_army_desc:0 "The Barani Army, or Tribal Army, consisted of infantry and cavalry who usually served for 1-2 years, bringing their own rifles and supplies. In their wars against their rivals, the Yemen have always relied mainly on their supporters from the tribes. These tribes usually inhabited the northern, north-western and eastern regions. This type of warriors is categorised as traditional national armies, led by tribal chieftains and without a regular order."
YEM_use_camels:0 "Use Camels in the Army"
YEM_use_camels_desc:0 "In fact, camels are not accustomed to the geography of Yemen, at least in San'a region, because Yemen is a country of complex mountain roads, where those who enter cannot get out. But living conditions began to force us to use camels. Just like in 1904 during our liberation war led by Imam Yahya. The Turks in the mountains of Moush were sent by us, bound hand and foot and pulled by camels..."
YEM_military_schools:0 "Yemeni Military School"
YEM_military_schools_desc:0 "In 1925, after the Hejaz Kingdom was destroyed by the Saudis, many liberals and soldiers fled to us. Among them was Hassan Tahsin al-Faqir. He was a great officer in the Ottoman Army. He was also an innovator. Thanks to him, our preparations for the end are over and we can open military schools, which will be the first step towards a trained, organised army, in addition to the soldiers we have recruited from the tribes."

YEM_foundation_of_the_defense_army:0 "Foundation of the Defense Army"
YEM_foundation_of_the_defense_army_desc:0 "Under the supervision of Hassan Tahsin al-Faqir, we first opened military schools. Our soldiers were trained. Now we need to put them into an army where they will be organised, and here again al-Faqir is involved. Unlike the victorious army, the training will be based on experience, not theory! However, there are still debates about whether this training period will be sufficient for the soldiers to master military training, combat skills and military training. The leadership says that we cannot afford to spend more money on training soldiers. Because now, with the conscription law, all Yemenis will join the army, not just the tribes."
YEM_adopt_new_doctrines:0 "Adopt New Doctrines"
YEM_adopt_new_doctrines_desc:0 "No one came to Yemen except orientalists. Because everyone's favourite was Aden. So we've been out of this doctrinal business for a long time. It's time to sort it out."
YEM_produce_modern_small_arms:0 "Produce Modern Small Arms Equipment"
YEM_produce_modern_small_arms_desc:0 "Although the rifles we had obtained from the Ottoman Empire were quite sufficient, they were becoming obsolete. This is the era of automatic weapons. We must keep up with it."
YEM_modernize_artillery:0 "Modernize Artillery"
YEM_modernize_artillery_desc:0 "When Fatih used cannons in the siege of Istanbul, the use of cannons started to attract everyone's attention, but Yemen was not included in this. As soon as the news came, the Imam of that time had it banned. But a lot has changed since then. In 1904, during our war of liberation, we took or stole many cannons from the Ottoman Empire, it depends on who you ask."
YEM_open_new_factories_for_ammunation:0 "Open New Ammunation Factories"
YEM_open_new_factories_for_ammunation_desc:0 "When the Kingdom of Yemen was first established, Yemen had nothing but agriculture, as the Ottoman Empire had invested more in the Balkans than in the Arabian Peninsula and Anatolia. It had no weapons other than the rifles it received from the Ottomans, the Kingdom of Italy and the United Kingdom. Ammunition is another problem. We have no proper ammunition except for rusted bullets. We need to solve this problem now"
YEM_modernization_of_the_army:0 "Modernization of the Army"
YEM_modernization_of_the_army_desc:0 "Having two armies creates many technical problems. For example, commanders even argue over who will defend an area, the victorious or the defence army. We must find a radical solution to this. Something like the Yemen Command, like they are all managed from one hand in modern systems."
YEM_continue_with_irregular_army:0 "Continue with Irregular Army"
YEM_continue_with_irregular_army_desc:0 "The Barani armies have been supporting us long enough. We can't spend more of our budget on modernisation. So it's better to stick with this irregular army system for the time being. "
YEM_motorization_of_the_army:0 "Motorization of the Army"
YEM_motorization_of_the_army_desc:0 "In the 1920s, with the introduction of the mechanical car, Imam Yahya did not want to be left behind, and established a national transport and transport company for the peasants who travelled to the cities to sell their goods and for transport. But this company did not cover the whole of Yemen. In addition, the army was still not provided with any vehicles. The time has come to resolve this."
YEM_armor_effort:0 "Armor Effort"
YEM_armor_effort_desc:0 "After Brigadier General Harold Jacob presented Imam Yahya with a Ford model car in 1923, we started to become more familiar with these 'mechanical cars'. And finally, we will be able to improve them and attach cannons to cars just like we attach cannons to camels! We firmly believe that it will be as beautiful like the Germans do!"
YEM_introduction_of_support_units:0 "Introduction of Support Units"
YEM_introduction_of_support_units_desc:0 "There was nothing but cannons and rifles in Yemen until this time. The reforms we've started are going marvellously, and as the final piece of that, the support equipment is coming in. Now our soldiers can use binoculars, shovels!"
YEM_special_forces:0 "Special Security Forces"
YEM_special_forces_desc:0 "Previously, the Yemeni army was only trained to collect taxes and defend the country. But things are changing. We need more professionally trained, highly skilled troops. These will be the main striking units of our army."
YEM_lift_the_aircraft_ban:0 "Lift the Aircraft Ban"
YEM_lift_the_aircraft_ban_desc:0 "With the help of the Germans and Italians, the Yemeni air force was established in 1926. 12 Yemenis were sent to Italy for flying training, and with the help of an Italian team, a flying school was established in Yemen. When the aeroplanes purchased from Italy arrived, Imam Yahya was extremely angry. They were all unable to fly. They reported this directly to Italy. Italy agreed to replace them with new ones, but although it is still a mystery, we think that the new ones they sent were also in a terrible condition. The planes delivered to Yemen crashed three months later, killing all three crew members. Imam Yahya banned the use of aeroplanes after that. But much has changed since then."
