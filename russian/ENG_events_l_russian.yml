 mtg_britain_agora.6.d:0 ""The United Kingdom has prepared a plan dubbed \"Operation Unthinkable\" with the aim to stop the spread of communism in Europe.

There is no doubt that Stalin will be angered, and will ensure a difficult fight for survival. Thorough consideration of our current situation is strongly advised. How shall we respond?""
 mtg_britain_agora.6.a:0 "The risk is worth taking"
 mtg_britain_agora.6.b:0 "There's a reason why it is unthinkable"

 mtg_britain_agora.8.t:0 "The United States Refuses"
 mtg_britain_agora.8.d:0 "The Americans have decided not to follow through with this proposal, stating that the world needs to demobilize and rebuild, with risks being too great to justify for an offenive war. Soviet intelligence and military strategic positioning are also deemed too counter-effective for the Allies to mount any successfull invasion, following the example of the invasion of the Axis powers as well."

 mtg_britain_agora.9.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] ambassador has contacted our diplomats proposing a trade agreement between our countries.

 mtg_britain_agora.11.t:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] rejects the English-German Trade Agreement"
 mtg_britain_agora.11.d:0 "After several attempts from our embassador to convince [FROM.GetAdjective] officials of the mutual benefits of a trade pact between our countries, [FROM.GetAdjective] diplomats have just informed us that they have no interest in establishing a trade agreement with [ROOT.GetNameDef]."

 mtg_britain_agora.12.d:0 "We received a delegation today expressing [From.GetLeader]'s interest in extending the relations between our countries and taking steps to unite the [Root.GetAdjective] people together with [From.GetNameDef]. Agreeing to [From.GetLeader]'s proposal would make [Root.GetNameDef] a moderately autonomous puppet of [From.GetNameDef] and our government will be reorganized into something more in line with [From.GetLeader]'s vision.\n\nThe question remains, is [Root.GetAdjective] independence more important than our friendship with [From.GetNameDef]?"
 mtg_britain_agora.12.a:0 "Submit to their demands."
 mtg_britain_agora.12.b:0 "Absolutely not!"

 mtg_britain_agora.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Defiant!"
 mtg_britain_agora.14.d:0 "Diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] arrived today to announce that they decline our offer to unite [From.GetNameDef] with [Root.GetNameDef]. Disappointing as it may be, the option to bring [From.GetNameDef] to heel by force remains a valid and tempting option."

 mtg_britain_agora.24.d:0 "Under the Constitution of the Irish Free State as originally enacted, the executive authority of the Irish Free State was declared to be vested in the King and declared to be exercisable by the Governor-General as representative of the Crown.\nIn response to the disruptive behaviour of the newly crowned King Edward VIII, the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State have enacted the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act abolishing the office of the Governor-General so that thereafter the executive government of the Irish Free State, insofar as internal matters were concerned, will cease to be exercised in the name of the King.\n\nIn practical terms this act has effectively severed the major links between the Irish Government and the British Crown, and signifies that Ireland can no longer be legally considered as a Dominion of the British Empire."
 mtg_britain_agora.24.a:0 "Ireland chooses her own path."

The British Government has sent a clarifying communique reaffirming the position of Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom."

 mtg_britain_agora.33.d: "The Anglo-Irish Trade war has been a sordid affair raging from 1933, arising from Irish refusals to reimburse land annuities from financial loans granted to Irish tenant farmers. This breach of the 1921 Treaty lead to a breakdown in relations, and subsequent trade restrictions from both countries. But the last few months have seen a build-up of reconciliatory legislation, beginning with the Coal-Cattle pact three years ago, and now with this treaty declaring a formal end to the state of affairs."

The terrorists, who also hid themselves among the servants of the palace, killed many servants and members of the royal family with guns in the palace to make sure that the royal family was dead. The army was deployed to restore order and clear the remaining terrorists."

 mtg_britain_agora.36.t:0 "Offer from Victoria Louise"
 mtg_britain_agora.36.d:0 "After the explosion at Buckingham Palace, there are no royals fit to lead the country. Victoria Louise took the opportunity to make us an offer.
