 #Arasaka Events
 japan.27.t:0 "Sandayu Oda offers to poison Saburo Arasaka"
 japan.27.desc:0 "Sandayu Oda, Hanako Arasaka's bodyguard, recently came with an offer. He said that he planned to poison Saburo Arasaka in a secret operation to make it look like he died of natural causes so that Hanako Arasaka, his boss, could take over the company. What will be our answer?"
 japan.27.a:0 "Hanako will be a better leader"
 japan.27.b:0 "Execute Sandayu Oda"

 japan.29.t:0 "War broke out at Arasaka Headquarters"
 japan.29.desc:0 "Saburo Arasaka, who has been poisoned in recent months, has sacrificed everything to find the antidote to the poison and has been researching like crazy. Taking advantage of the chaos and the fact that the company has been leaderless for some time, Hanako and her bodyguard Sandayu Oda attack the headquarters with a group of Arasaka soldiers."
 japan.29.a:0 "Hanako is moving forward"
 japan.29.c:0 "Hanako is after Saburo"

 japan_news.1.t:0 "Rise of Arasaka Corporation"
 japan_news.1.desc_2:0 "Arasaka Corporation has taken over Japan and declared that it is now a new country, a continuation of the Japanese Empire. This company, which aims to improve human life and stop wars with its advanced technologies, is already attracting a lot of attention in Japan and is being welcomed by the public, but what the public forgets is that the any company will sacrifice everything to keep its power."
 japan_news.1.desc:0 "According to the latest news, Japan has fallen into the hands of a dangerous company. Arasaka was a company that produced weapons for Japan, but the government became so dependent on the company that it eventually managed to take over the country from within. It is possible for a company to grow rapidly, but it is very dangerous for such a dangerous company to take over a country and hesitantly using all the resources of this country for their own interests. We hope this doesn't set an example for other companies and we don't have to be enemies of our companies."

 JAP_HANAKO_WINS:0 "After a long and bloody battle, Hanako's men emerged victorious. There was blood all over the Arasaka headquarters. Hanako's men arrested Saburo and put him in prison, his days are numbered because the poison will kill him sooner or later."
 JAP_SABURO_WINS:0 "Saburo surprisingly won this battle. He exiled his daughter and stripped her of many of her powers. Sandayu Oda was executed. It seems that a lot of effort will be made to keep these events out of the press."
