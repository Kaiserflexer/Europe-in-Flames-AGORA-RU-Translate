 frig_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb:1 "Converted Battleship Hull"
 frig_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb_desc:0 "After years of experiments, the aircraft carrier has slowly matured into its own class of ship. Capable of supporting a growing number of ever more powerful aircraft, the aircraft carrier stands poised to become the last word in naval power projection."
 frig_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_ca:1 "Converted Cruiser Hull"
 frig_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_ca_desc:0 "After years of experiments, the aircraft carrier has slowly matured into its own class of ship. Capable of supporting a growing number of ever more powerful aircraft, the aircraft carrier stands poised to become the last word in naval power projection."
