 argentina.1.t:0 "Which city should we make the Capital?"
 argentina.1.d:0 "With our recent conquest of the crucial city of Buenos Aires, a dilemma arises. Should we make Buenos Aires the capital, or should we keep Paraná the capital? Both cities have historical meanings to the Argentine Confederation.\n\n Paraná was the capital of the original Confederation after the secession of Buenos Aires, and Buenos Aires was and has been the capital of both the Confederation and every Argentine government that took power.\n\n Which city would we name capital of the Argentine Confederation?"
 argentina.1.a:0 "Make Buenos Aires the Capital"
 argentina.1.b:0 "Keep Paraná the Capital"
 news.360.t:0 "The Argentine Confederation is Established Once More"
 news.360.d:0 "\n After nationalist sentiments started arising in Argentina, many people started believing once more in the Confederation as a saving grace, one that will allow the country to go forward and establish itself as a regional power. \n\n After a brutal civil war in which the Confederation came out victorious, one is to wonder what they are going to do now. \n\n Only time will tell what the resurrection of a once abolished state will cause on this planet."
 news.360.a:0 "Wait, there's more than one Confederacy in the Americas?"
 news.360.b:0 "The world shall now know our true strength!"
 argentina.2.t:0 "Argentina just Annexed Uruguay!"
 argentina.2.d:0 "Uruguay has always been an area of key interest. Letting it go just like that is something that can't be done. \n\n Ever since the end of the Cisplatine war and the UK making us let go of our territories in Uruguay, it has always acted as almost a buffer territory, where neither country can and should touch it. That proposal was respected up until today, where news came that Argentina annexed Uruguay. \n\n The Argentines will not expect an attack from us at this moment, so the sooner we cross the border the better. Catching them off guard will be key in making this operation work. \n\n So what should we do, should we step in and intervene, or should we hold back and let them have Uruguay?"
 argentina.2.a:0 "Step in, a treaty was signed and a treaty shall be respected!"
 argentina.2.b:0 "Maybe it's best we just let them have it"
 argentina.3.t:0 "Brazil has Declared war on us!"
 argentina.3.d:0 "After our annexation of Uruguay, the Brazilian government has decided to respond by declaring war on us. \n\n Just a few hours ago reports came in that Brazilian soldiers crossed the border near the province of Misiones. \n\n Whatever their reason may be for declaring war on us holds absolutely no value on the international stage, and they will be alone in this conflict, as it should be."
 argentina.3.a:0 "If these damn Brazilians want a war, then they will get one!"
 news.338.t:0 "The Second Cisplatine War"
 news.338.d:0 "After the rather unexpected intervention of Uruguay by the Argentine government, the Brazilian government has decided to respond by invading them, claiming it was wrong to simply intervene in Uruguay's affairs the way the Argentines did. \n\n Skirmishes are already happening all around the border and many are worried that this war may turn into a bloodbath, with both sides being equally eager to fight the other. \n\n Only time will tell how this conflict evolves, however, the situation looks rather grim."
 news.338.a:0 "Just what in the hell is going on in that continent?"
 news.338.c:0 "We'll show these Argentines that you don't mess with the sovereignty of others!"

 argentina.4.t:0 "We have Done all the Necessary Damage Towards Brazil"
 argentina.4.d:0 "With casualties stacking up on the Brazilian side and many of their towns and southern territory being occupied, it seems unlikely the Brazilians will want to continue this war. \n\n Should we make peace with them, take advantage of the situation and demand Santa Catarina, or simply continue the war?"
 argentina.4.a:0 "Make Peace with the Brazilians"

 argentina.12.b:0 "Absolutely not! We are not giving these Argies anything!"
 argentina.13.t:0 "Argentina is Demanding Tarija!"
 argentina.13.d:0 "Argentina is demanding we cede them the province of Tarija, a territory we currently own. \n\n However, we don't have the army to stand up to them, so maybe the better choice would be to cave in. What should we do?"
 argentina.13.a:0 "Give them Tarija"
 argentina.13.b:0 "If we have to, we'll fight for our land!"

 argentina.16.d:0 "Argentina is demanding we give them Santa Catarina, a territory which they owned at the beginning of their lifespan as a country. However, they don't own that anymore, and we have owned that territory for many decades now and the people there are more Brazilian than Argentine. \n\n Should we give in or refuse?"
 argentina.16.a:0 "We need to maintain Peace, even if it's at the cost of our territory"

 news.339.d:0 "After various conquests against her neighbors, taking territory from them and causing a lot of tension in South America, the Argentine Confederation has announced that they will now be called the "Greater Argentine Confederation". \n\n The nation seems to be much stronger than what others have previously anticipated, and being a fascist power, could maybe even turn the tide of the war in Europe."

 argentina.23.t:0 "Argentina Proposes an Economic Alliance Between our Nations"
 argentina.23.d:0 "Argentina diplomats have arrived in Madrid today to not only congratulate us in our recent victory in the civil war, but also to propose an economic alliance between our nation. \n\n The diplomats have told us that both our economies cooperating will help both countries equally, with seemingly no downsides. Not only that, but economic cooperation will also allow us to develop closer to ties to Argentina, and it can be rather useful to have a South American ally. \n\n Dowe accept their proposal for economic cooperation?"

 argentina.48.t:0 "The Military Hospital Scandal"
 argentina.48.d:0 "Almost half a year after the inauguration of the Military Hospital in Palomar, senator Benjamín Villafañe has placed a lawsuit on us and the military for this very hospital. \n\nThe reason for the lawsuit was due to the selling of land for the Military Hospital. The lands were sold for a much greater price than what they truly were. The senator claims that the rest of the money that still needs to be paid is to be dispersed amongst deputies and employees,a s well as functionaries in the Ministry of War. \n\nAll that we can do now is wait for the senators in the legislative assembly to vote whether we are innocent or not and if we have to pay back the money."

 argentina.53.t:0 "What should we do with the Militias?"
 argentina.53.d:0 "With the civil war out of the way, we still have the issue on what to do with the remaining Militias. \n\nOn one hand, we can keep them in the army and maybe even train them to be even better, and on the other hand we can disband them and keep both the manpower that was used for those militias and the equipment that they acquired. \n\nWhat should we do?"

 argentina.54.d:0 "After rising tensions in the globe, tensions were also rising behind the scenes.

Edelmiro Julian Farrell, one of the main contributors of the military plot that was performed about a year ago. \n\nThis sudden switch of power might catch many people by surprise and could even throw the country into turmoil, so we best hope that doesn't occur."

 argentina.55.t:0 "Argentina's Situation in 1939"
 argentina.55.d:0 "Roberto has proven himself to be a competent leader as of now, however, his health condition is deteriorating at a rapid rate ever since he got elected. Doctors do not know how much longer he will last, and rough estimates suggest he will be forced to retire around 1942. \n\nAs with Peron's situation, he is currently in Italy studying mountain warfare.

 argentina.59.d:0 "We just now received the news that Argentine troops crossed the Uruguayan border, with what seems to be annexation intentions. \n\nThe last time Argentina tried anything similar to this, we stepped in and defended Uruguay from an Argentine annexation, and this situation seems way too familiar. \n\nShould we help out our Uruguayan brothers and sisters and beat back the Argentines?"

 chile.48.d:0 "Today marks a sad day for the Chilean people, as the president and leader of the Frente Popular, Pedro Aguirre Cerda, passed away in office. His cause of death was tuberculosis, this was nothing new to Pedro however, as he already knew his health condition was deteriorating. That's why he appointed Jerónimo Méndez as vice president. \n\nBecause of his death, Jerónimo will now step up and take over Pedro's original position and lead the people of Chile until the 1942 elections. What lies next is great challenges for mister Jerónimo, but the people are sure he will pull through."

 chile.49.d:0 "As distant as 1942 seemed, it surprised many to realize we're already there, and the elections have just begun. \n\nVarious politicians are running for office, with the most prominent one being Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, who was already president of Chile before, and wants to run for office yet again but as an independent politician. \n\nThese elections are going to get quite hectic, butt in the end the winner of the 1942 elections is..."

 uruguay.2.d:0 "Police officers from our government have arrested people who seemed rather suspicious.

 uruguay.3.t:0 "Some of Our Prisoners Were Set Free"
 uruguay.3.d:0 "News has just come to us that some of our prisoners were set free today. \n\nHow they escaped is up to debate, we do not know if they escaped on their own or if other people helped them. Hell, maybe even people from our own government helped them. \n\nWhatever it may be, this is a clear sign that we need to be even harsher on the population to make sure this doesn't happen again."
 uruguay.3.a:0 "Maybe There is an Underlying Reason as to Why This Happened"
 uruguay.5.t:0 "Terra and his Loyal Supporters Take Over the Country"
 uruguay.5.d:0 "After the news got spread to every Uruguayan of Terra being kicked out forcefully from office, many of his loyal supporters took the streets to violently protest his ousting. \n\nEvery city, every street, every block, there are Loyalists doing everything in their power to get Terra back in power. Violence is being abused massively by the mobs and many people have already lost their lives due to them. \n\nWe have to act fast against the protestors if we want our country to stay afloat, and that will unfortunately mean more blood spilled, but it has reached a point where it is a must."
 uruguay.5.a:0 "You Will Pay, Terra!"
 uruguay.6.t:0 "Roosevelt Has Arrived In Montevideo"
 uruguay.6.d:0 "Just an hour ago Roosevelt has arrived in Montevideo and is coming to visit Terra to discuss various political issues and improve diplomatic relations. He was received with cheering crowds and waving American and Uruguayan flags, and many pictures of both presidents were taken. \n\nLet's hope we can further improve our relations with the Americans and have them as an ally in the future."
 uruguay.6.a:0 "For the Greater Good of Both our Nations!"
 uruguay.7.t:0 "Uruguayan Elections"
 uruguay.7.d:0 "After reforming the Uruguayan Constitution, Gabriel Terra has allowed free elections to occur after multiple years. This is a great step forward in our nation. \n\nTwo major political parties stand out, the Colorado and the Nacional. Both are crucial in Uruguay, and have decided much of this nation's history, with even a civil war occuring in the 1860s because of it. \n\nWho is winning the elections?"
 uruguay.7.a:0 "Partido Nacional"
 uruguay.7.b:0 "Partido Colorado"
 uruguay.8.t:0 "Uruguay is Proposing a Peace Agreement Between our Nations"
 uruguay.8.d:0 "Uruguayan diplomats have arrived today in Buenos Aires to propose a peace agreement between our nation. Uruguay is well aware that they are a threat to us and want to have a pact with us. \n\nThe diplomats state that there will be no war between our nations and that we will both co-operate peacefully and build each of our nations up. \n\nThere are many threats around us, so accepting this agreement isn't that far-fetched. Should we do it?"
 uruguay.8.a:0 "Yes, let's work with our new Allies"
 uruguay.8.b:0 "No, we have other plans"
 uruguay.9.t:0 "Argentina Accepts Our Proposal"

 uruguay.11.t:0 "Trucks Carrying Some of Our Soldiers Have Just Been Blown Up!"
 uruguay.11.d:0 "Trucks carrying some of our soldiers have just been blown up in Entre Rios near the Uruguayan border! After closer inspection it has been found that Uruguayan soldiers have in fact crossed the border and deliberately set up explosives to blow them up. \n\nThis is nothing short of an act of terrorism against Argentina and the Argentine people and the Uruguayans are more than fully aware of that. \n\nThere is simply no way we can just stay with our arms crossed and let them get away with this, in just a few hours every Argentine is going to learn of the atrocity and plead for war against the Uruguayans, and are we really just going to ignore our people like that?"
 uruguay.11.a:0 "They will pay with every inch of blood they have!"
 uruguay.11.b:0 "We simply aren't in the shape to declare war on the Uruguayans."
 uruguay.12.t:0 "Argentina did not Declare War on Us as we Hoped They would"
 uruguay.12.d:0 "24 hours have passed and there has been no response from Argentina, and it seems as if they will not be declaring war on us in order to get Brazil to help us. \n\nWe will have to dual out with the Argentines single-handedly, which is something we might not be able to do."

 uruguay.13.t:0 "The Uruguayans Are Asking Us to Join Their War Against Argentina"
 uruguay.13.d:0 "Uruguayans diplomats have arrived today, presumably more tired than normal, asking us to join their war against Argentina. They told us that in exchange we will gain Formosa for our war participation. \n\nShould we accept this offer?"
 uruguay.13.a:0 "Sure, the Argentines Stand No Chance!"
 uruguay.13.b:0 "We Can't Afford a War Right Now"
 uruguay.14.t:0 "The Paraguayans Declined Our Request"
 uruguay.14.d:0 "The Paraguayans have told our diplomats that they will not be joining the war against Argentina, saying that they are in no shape of being at war right now."
 uruguay.14.a:0 "Understandable"
 uruguay.15.t:0 "Uruguay Is Proposing a Way to Split Up Argentina"
 uruguay.15.d:0 "Uruguayan diplomats have arrived today to tell us that they have a plan to split up Argentina. \n\nFor starters, Uruguay will gain all the Rioplatense provinces, which are Buenos Aires, Entre Rios, Santa Fe, La Pampa, Neuquen, Rio Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz, and Tierra Del Fuego. \n\nWe will gain the provinces of Missiones and Corrientes, and the rest of Argentina will become a satellite of ours. \n\nShould  we accept this peace offer?"
 uruguay.15.a:0 "Sure, it seems fair"
 uruguay.15.b:0 "No, we were the ones who did the most work!"
 uruguay.16.t:0 "Brazil refuses our Peace Offering"
 uruguay.16.d:0 "The Brazilians have responded to our diplomats, saying they will not stand by these peace offers and prefer to split Argentina the way we have now."
 uruguay.16.a:0 "God Damn You Brazil..."
 uruguay.17.t:0 "Who Should Lead Our Nation?"
 uruguay.17.d:0 "With the civil war in full swing and our nation in chaos, one question is raised above any other, who should lead the country? \n\nImprisoning Terra has caused the new state that was to be created to be near anarchy, and we need a strong leader as soon as possible. Due to his imprisonment, democratic and communist ideals spread to all the Uruguayan people who are against Terra. \n\nThis may be the last time the people decide who the nation will be led by, so we have to make the right decision and fast. After a rushed election, the winner is..."
 uruguay.17.a:0 "The Consejo Provisionario will lead for now."
 uruguay.17.b:0 "Eugenio Gómez will lead to represent the workers."
 uruguay.18.t:0 "[GetYear] Elections"
 uruguay.18.d:0 "Despite the situation that led the parties to form the coalition, pressure from all democratic sectors of the country had been mounting on [URG.GetLeader], demanding the return of free elections, with some radicals even claiming that [URG.GetLeader] is seeking to keep power to himself and, caving under the pressure, [URG.GetLeader] had scheduled elections for [GetYear]. \n\nEven with the situation in the country being far from stable, it seems [URG.GetLeader] has delivered on his promise and, today, voters had to decide between voting for either Emilio Frugoni, Luis Batlle Berres or Luis Alberto de Herrera. While Frugoni and Batlle enjoy relative popularity amongst the population, Luis Alberto de Herrera is seen by most liberals as a traitor to the country, only being defended by those who supported Terra. However, all candidates enjoy from a good voter base, giving them all a chance to win this important election. \n\nOn [GetDateText], as votes are being counted, it's all but obvious that..."
 uruguay.18.a:0 "Luis Batlle Berres won the elections!"
 uruguay.18.b:0 "Emilio Frugoni won the elections!"
 uruguay.18.c:0 "Luis Alberto de Herrera won the elections!"
 uruguay.19.t:0 "Luis Batlle Berres resigns!"
 uruguay.19.d:0 "The increasing efforts of the opposition to block his attempts at reform has taken a toll on Batlle Berres' popularity and power within the party. Using this situation to his adventage, Andrés Martínez Trueba made a deal with Luís Alberto de Herrera of the Partido Nacional, gaining his support and further increasing the pressure against Batlle Berres. \n\nHaving gained enough power after the deal with Herrera, Martínez began pressuring Batlle Berres to make concessions to him. And finally, he began pressuring him and his cabinet to resign. Knowing that Martínez had the gained control of both of the legislative chambers and the support of the Partido Nacional, today, at noon, president Luis Batlle Berres announced his resignation in the Camaras de Senadores y Diputados, soon followed by the resignation of his VP Alfeo Brum and all of his cabinet, taking most of the nation by surprise. \n\nUsing his support on the parliament, Martínez managed to get elected as a interim president by a slim majority."
 uruguay.19.a:0 "Success"
 uruguay.20.t:0 "[GetYear] Constitutional Referendum"
 uruguay.20.d:0 "Just little after a week after assuming the presidency, Andrés Martínez proposed a constitutional reform, which seeked to abolish the presidency and to replace it with a new system based on the Consejo Nacional de Administración, which was abolished by Gabriel Terra in 1933. This was made in order to keep his end of the deal with Herrera, as both parties had agreed to cooperate only if powered was shared between the both parties. \n\nSaid reform was voted by the population a week ago in a referendum, with the options to keep the constitution as it is or to accept the new proposal. And after counting the remaining votes, the Corte Electoral announced today that the refendum..."
 uruguay.20.a:0 "...Passed!"
 uruguay.20.b:0 "...Failed?!"
 uruguay.21.t:0 "Political Deadlock"
 uruguay.21.d:0 "Following the results of the referendum, political bickering between both parties led to the coalition between the Partido Colorado and the Partido Nacional breaking apart. With both the Nacional and Colorado parties fractured in opposing factions, both parliament and the executive power have been slowed to a crawl, making the government unable to take any action to aleviate the tensions between both parties and making the rounding up of Terrist renmnants much more difficult. \n\nAll of this tension has led to a standoffish and tense mood in Montevideo, as the differences between parties continue to grow and cracks begin appearing both in the new government and the democratic system."
 uruguay.21.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 uruguay.22.t:0 "The Government Collapses!"
 uruguay.22.d:0 "The unthinkable has happended! Just little before a month of political deadlock and unrest has taken a toll of both the citizenship and the government of Martínez. \n\nFollowing massive protests on Plaza Independencia and the Palacio Legislativo, Martínez has announced his resignation, followed shortly by the rest of his cabinet. Any attempts by the parliament to name an interim has been met with failure, due to a lack of cooperation from the PN and the pressure from the discontent civilian population. "

 uruguay.28.t:0 "The State of the Economy"
 uruguay.28.d:0 "Ever since its independence back in 1830, Uruguay has been an agrarian society, with the most of the income coming from estancias in the countryside. However, with the industrial revolution in Europe, foreign industries began coming to Uruguay, and with them, came the industrial machinery. This began a process of urbanization and industrialization centered around the capital of Montevideo. Despite all of this, most of the nation's income still comes from agricultural exports, which came into play in the great war, where Uruguay entered a golden age thanks to the income of these exports. \n\nNow, with tensions brewing in both Europe and the rest of the world, economists began debating over whether this system is sustainable on the long run, or if it's time for Uruguay to catch up to modern times. Some members of the government are also worried that a drastic change in our economy could bring discontent amongst the rural population and the elites."

 uruguay.29.t:0 "The Fate of the Welfare State"
 uruguay.29.de:0 "As we continue to create projects to expand our economic situation, it has become harder to maintain a positive surplus on our annual budget. With this in mind, some members of our cabinet have suggested a reform to the many welfare programs sponsored by the goverment. \n\n\nThis has led to a controversial debate, as these programs are highly popular with the people and extensive reforms could prove very unpopular. Some politicians have also argued that a complete abolishment of these programs would allow us to quickly industrialize, but this action could generate backlash from both the populace and other politicians."
 uruguay.29.a:0 "Maintain the current system."

Said brand has been having notable success due to the rising tensions, with many nations beginning to stockpile canned goods in case of an all-out war. \n\nThis leaves us in an interesting position, as many nations are willing to buy our goods, but the limited size of the plant and manpower means it can only cover the demands of one major nation. Arguments could be made to help either side, but it could also be consumed locally if we cannot secure a buyer."

 colombia.41.desc:0 "After organizing a large unit of militants, backed by both a large part of the civilian population and the clerical sector, a powerful conservative assault force was formed that attacked the presidential palace last night with such a decision that the local guard was unable to respond. As expected, [COL.GetLeader] had not foreseen this situation, so isolating him and his cabinet in the presidential office was a fairly simple task. The main leaders of conservatism, Gilberto Alzate Avendaño and Laureano Gómez, were soon in attendance. They were received with a standing ovation from supporters who gathered outside the palace to keep abreast of the situation. \n\nAfter several hours, late at night, [COL.GetLeader] finally agreed to sign the resignation and hand over command of the country to the conservative party. The news spread through the streets, and while party supporters celebrated, inside of the palace there was a battle to choose which of the two leaders would take office: the daring falangist Gilberto Alzate or the staunch traditionalist Laureano Gómez."

The disagreements within liberalism, added to the reproaches of the conservative party, divided the public administration and made it impossible to govern. In contrast, he argued that his mandate could not continue under this scenario, and that he should cede command to someone who did enjoy widespread popular support. Thus, [FROM.GetLeader] formally resigned from the presidential command to hand it over to the current mayor of Bogotá (and candidate for the next elections) Jorge Eliécer Gaitán. \n\nGaitán is an illustrious personality, who not only moves the entire Colombian people with his eloquence and tenacity, but also shows real interest in completely reforming the Colombian system. Among a huge celebration by his followers, Gaitán assumed command of the republic and, after an exquisite discourse, the slogan of his campaign was heard in unison: People, for your victory, charge!"

 colombia.43.desc:0 "The militias organized by the conservative party were not effective enough for the coup. The plan was to attack the presidential palace and force [COL.GetLeader] to resign. However, the presidential guard had long enough to notify the army of the situation. The armed forces mobilized and in a matter of minutes the situation was in absolute chaos. Radio stations spread the message quickly and, in anger, hundreds of conservative militants stormed the armories from the police stations and formed large groups of civilians. The onslaught of these divisions was so severe that the opponents, the liberal supporters, also took to the streets with weapons in hand. \n\nThe situation escalated until the two main leaders of the party Conservative, Laureano Gómez and Gilberto Alzate Avendaño, declared that "in the face of the failure of the civilian struggle, only force remains", thus initiating a civil war between conservative supporters and remaining loyalists to the [COL.GetLeader] administration. Even in the army itself, hundreds of soldiers deserted to join the conservative ranks. The republic is now in unprecedented disarray."

It evoked the many decades in which the isthmus was under our control and was ignored by current governments. It asserted that the struggle for the independence of Panama was a definitive and irreversible event, and that the people of Panama must prosper on their own. It is obvious that before an invasion of our forces the isthmus will be defenseless. However, the main drawback is that there is no land route to the region, since the Darien gap is an impregnable jungle. "

 colombia.96.desc:0 "The republic is in mourning. After suffering several health problems, general Vásquez Cobo, hero of the Colombian-Peruvian war and great opponent of the politicians, died today. His advanced age was not an impediment to lead the coup against the two traditional parties, which were leading the nation to a state of cyclical and perpetual violence. His legacy will live on in the future of the nation and his dedication will never be forgotten by the Colombian people. But now the question is: who will lead the republic? "
 colombia.96.a:0 "Establishing a Military Junta will keep personal interests out."

The Brazilian forces have withdrawn and have been disorganized while ours have triumphantly occupied the state. There is no need to wait to find out that [BRA.GetLeader] will not react in the best way to this event, but at least the supremacy of our army over theirs has been assured. Japurá will soon be officially reintegrated to Colombia."
 colombia.97.desc2:0 "The rapid offensive of our troops was a brutal clash between our army and the Brazilian. The resulting combat lasted for a time until ending with our victory and subsequent occupation of Mapari. The commanders of the battalions have received multiple praise for this victory as well as the general in charge of leading the confrontation. Mapari is definitely under Colombian control, as it should be."

The Brazilian forces put up fierce resistance and it was impossible for our soldiers to secure the territory. No need to wait to find out that [BRA .GetLeader] will not react in the best way to this event no matter how successful they are. In the worst-case scenario, a full-scale war could break out between our nations."
 colombia.98.desc2:0 "The rapid offensive of our troops was a brutal clash between our army and the Brazilian. The resulting combat lasted for a time, but unfortunately we were unable to take control of Mapari. The commanders of the battalions can't explain how such a planned attack did not have the expected success, while the general in command alludes to various factors of different kinds. The troops have been very demoralized by this defeat, just as public opinion questions the true effectiveness of our army."

It was something we expected knowing the dictatorial ambitions of [COL.GetLeader]. Fortunately, our brave soldiers succeeded in stopping their operation and repelled the invaders. This heroic defense has shown that our army continues to be of a higher standard, reinforcing our sovereignty in the region and our national unity."
 colombia.99.desc2:0 "An unexpected Colombian attack on the garrisons in Mapari forced our men to engage the aggressors. Fortunately, the divisions were strong enough to hold their positions and not even a meter of land ended up under enemy control.

It was something we expected knowing the dictatorial ambitions of [COL.GetLeader]. Unfortunately, our army was unable to repel the attack and the state has fallen into the hands of the Colombians. It seems that our nation is in decline, and it is possible that other nations take advantage of this appearance to gain their own advantage."
 colombia.100.desc2:0 "An unexpected Colombian attack on the garrisons in Mapari forced our men to engage in combat with the aggressors. Unfortunately, it was impossible to repel the attack and the state has ended up under Colombian occupation.

Several of those exiles have offered the government to collaborate with us in our struggle, giving us their knowledge about the internal workings of the country to obtain a strategic advantage. Our government advisers don't agree about accepting or not this offer, as we are uncertain about his intentions or if they are even true."

[PRU.GetLeader] has notified its gratitude to our government, and hopes that the relations between the new nation and ours will be close and rewarding. However, they may be suspicious of our intentions to maintain the hegemony of the region, which could lead to future conflict.

It is very likely that they will count with the military support of the Colombians, but the situation does not allow us to deal with them now.

It doesn't seem like they want to be repaid, as long as we allow their plantations to thrive under our management."
 brazil.1.a:0 "This will be of great help!"


 brazil.2.t:0 "Urban Development has Destroyed one of our Plantations"
 brazil.2.d:0 "News has come to us that urban development has expanded so much that it has destroyed a plantation. The owners of said plantation are very mad at our 'negligence' of the situation and demand we re-establish their plantation and/or cut back on our urban development. \n\nAt this stage we need to industrialize our nation so stepping back at this point will not cut it. Our dependency on coffee will decrease, but maybe it's for the better."
 brazil.2.a:0 "Sorry about that..."


 brazil.3.t:0 "Illegal Coffee Plantation has Been Set Up"
 brazil.3.d:0 "Due to the diminishing power of the coffee plantations on the nation's economy, many have started setting up illegal plantations in different parts of the country. The owners of these illegal plantations seem to be annoyed at our management of the plantations, and they claim we have been treating them rather poorly, so that's why they decided to protest by setting up these illegal plantations. \n\nShould we stop the people behind these illegal plantations?

 brazil.5.t:0 "The Plantations have been Successfully Stopped"
 brazil.5.d:0 "After many months of back and forths, we were able to successfully stop the rebelling plantations and calm down the situation. Due to the mass protests and bloody repression of them, we will most likely never be able to depend on coffee, at least for a long time. \n\nThe good thing is we can now fully focus on building up our economy and growing our industry.

 brazil.36.t:0 "Hostile Coffee Plantations Have Boycotted Their Profits"
