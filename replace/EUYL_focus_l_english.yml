 COL_la_revolucion_en_marcha:0 "The Marching Revolution"
 COL_la_revolucion_en_marcha_desc:0 "López Pumarejo's flagship program, the so-called Revolución en Marcha, is popular even among conservatives. It aims at the modernization of the country, industrialization, updating of social laws and structural reforms of society. In short, it enshrines that the duty of the state is to "effect by peaceful means everything that would make a revolution.""
 COL_integrar_la_inversion_militar:0 "Military Investment Integration"
 COL_integrar_la_inversion_militar_desc:0 "In these troubled times, military spending is essential to the defense of the nation. Increasing investment and including war materiel in public spending will be very beneficial in the long run."
 COL_ley_de_movilizacion_militar:0 "National Conscription Law"
 COL_ley_de_movilizacion_militar_desc:0 "The rules governing military service have not been modified since the beginning of the Thousand Days' War in 1899. It is time to renew this legislation to swell the ranks of the army, navy and air force."

 reforma_tt:0 "§RThe oligarchs won't like that the State goes against their interests.§!\n"
 COL_continuar_la_reforma_agraria_desc:0 "It is evident that in Colombia the distribution of land is unequal; while the large landowners appropriate entire hectares, the peasants are left on the sidelines and unable to compete economically. We must insist on ratifying an agrarian reform, which justifies the partition of the land and state intervention, even if it's something burdensome."
 COL_mantener_los_privilegios_patronales:0 "Maintain Employer Privileges"
 privilegios_tt:0 "§RThe people won't like that the state priorize the oligarchs.§!\n"
 COL_mantener_los_privilegios_patronales_desc:0 "It is a fact that Colombian landowners are the ones who best know how to manage agricultural production. We can't just put anyone in charge or the entire economy would collapse. Although it hurts to the trade unions, preserving the legal privileges of the employers is the only way to develop the country."
 COL_surcando_mar_y_oceano:0 "Sailing through Sea and Ocean"
 COL_surcando_mar_y_oceano_desc:0 "Colombian ships must be prepared to navigate both shallow waters and inclement oceans. After all, the country has an outlet to the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea. There is no point more strategic than ours."
 COL_astilleros_del_pacifico:0 "The Pacific Dockyards"
 COL_astilleros_del_pacifico_desc:0 "Part of developing the nation economically is embracing the ability to manufacture our own ships. The Pacific coast, being an important point of commerce and direct exit to the east, is the perfect place to position this industry. "
 COL_armada_de_la_republica:0 "The Navy of the Republic"
 COL_armada_de_la_republica_desc:0 "It is unheard of that we have only three obsolete destroyers while other American nations even have battleships. It is obvious that we cannot match their naval strength immediately, but the first step is to properly structure the navy following the example of the great powers."
 COL_la_mision_de_rojas_pinilla:0 "The Mission of Rojas Pinilla"
 COL_la_mision_de_rojas_pinilla_desc:0 "During the Colombian-Peruvian war of 1932, Lieutenant Gustavo Rojas Pinilla argued that Colombian military industry and study techniques are outdated. For this reason, the high command has prepared a special mission to update these aspects, and it only requires the presidential sanction to carry it out."
 COL_fuerza_aerea_colombiana:0 "The Colombian Air Force"
 COL_fuerza_aerea_colombiana_desc:0 "It is still remembered that the first president in the world to use an official aircraft was the Colombian Pedro Nel Ospina in 1922. Our history has been linked to aviation from the moment they became intertwined, and this legacy cannot be lost. Colombia must have an air force on par with the major powers."
 COL_ejercito_nacional:0 "The National Army"
 COL_ejercito_nacional_desc:0 "Our glorious army has its roots in independence, and since then brave soldiers have given themselves body and soul to the defense of our sovereignty. The institution requires special treatment from the government, as it represents the entire war history of the country: Fatherland, Honor, Loyalty."
 COL_produccion_aeronautica:0 "Aeronautical Production"
 COL_produccion_aeronautica_desc:0 "Importing airplanes from other countries will be totally unsustainable in the context of a full-scale war. The internal industry must be adapted to the needs of the Air Force, using modern and sophisticated assembly lines."
 COL_modernizar_el_armamento:0 "Modernize the Weapons"
 COL_modernizar_el_armamento_desc:0 "We cannot continue to supply our troops with weapons from a decade ago and expect their performance to be outstanding. It is necessary to redirect part of the military spending in the development of updated and efficient equipment capable of dealing with foreign machinery."
 COL_indumil:0 "INDUMIL"
 COL_indumil_desc:0 "It is clear that the monopoly of arms production cannot be handed over to any private individual, but neither can the State sustain dispersed and disorganized production. The appropriate thing will be to centralize production in a public company, the Colombian Military Industry (INDUMIL)."
 COL_tacticas_aereas:0 "Air Tactics"
 COL_tacticas_aereas_desc:0 "Air combat is complex, much more than land or sea combat. It involves a large amount of disciplines and knowledge that needs to be studied in detail. Otherwise, we will be doomed to lose the war in the air."
 COL_fabricas_nacionales:0 "National Factories"
 COL_fabricas_nacionales_desc:0 "Our production is becoming more and more dependent on foreign industry. This vicious cycle must be curbed by financing factories with national headquarters that create jobs and maintain good performance in times of crisis."
 COL_estrategia_de_altamar:0 "The High Seas Strategy"
 COL_estrategia_de_altamar_desc:0 "Fighting in the open sea is not the same as crossing a river or a lagoon. The navy must be prepared to do battle in places far from the coast, even if it means restructuring the entire naval training program."
 COL_vigilancia_costera:0 "Coastal Patrolling"
 COL_vigilancia_costera_desc:0 "We must accept that we are incapable of protecting the nation's vast maritime boundaries. The only viable option to defend ourselves is to establish a patrolling system along the Pacific coast and the Caribbean, thus keeping naval intelligence updated in real time."
 COL_fuego_del_cielo:0 "Fire from the skies"
 COL_fuego_del_cielo_desc:0 "If we cannot charge militarily on the ground, then we will rampage from the air. We will develop bomber models able to attack key enemy points, and we will make them tremble by deploying a rain of fire of biblical proportions over them. "
 COL_artilleria_arrolladora:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
 COL_artilleria_arrolladora_desc:0 "Firepower is essential on the front lines. We will spend crucial time studying this type of weapon to equip our brave gunners with the necessary tools, with which the enemy will be left defenseless."
 COL_motorizar_la_infanteria:0 "Motorize the Infantry"
 COL_motorizar_la_infanteria_desc:0 "In the long term, a cavalry battalion is much more logistically costly than a motorized one. We cannot afford to take multi-day horseback riding to the front while our divisions urgently need reinforcements. We will implement a massive motorization plan to make a competent army."
 COL_fortalecer_la_marina_mercante:0 "Strengthen the Merchant Marine"
 COL_fortalecer_la_marina_mercante_desc:0 "The merchant marine may not be very useful in peacetime, but in a war they will be an essential support for logistics and transportation.

 COL_proteccion_desde_las_profundidades:0 "Protection from the Depths"
 COL_proteccion_desde_las_profundidades_desc:0 "The future of naval combat is not in the waves, but under them. Using a fleet of submarines will give us a huge advantage against a surface attacker, and we will even be able to weaken their trade and transport."
 COL_policia_militar:0 "Military police"
 COL_policia_militar_desc:0 "A regular police made up of civilians, is not the most suitable for a nation with a war legacy like ours. We will militarize the institution so that it serves as a support not only in the internal order, but also on the battlefield if it becomes necessary."
 COL_defensa_desde_tierra:0 "Defense From Ground"
 COL_defensa_desde_tierra_desc:0 "We are too delusional if we believe that the navy is sufficient defense against a naval invasion. We need to establish a line of protection capable of protecting ourselves, so we will order the construction of hundreds of forts that will be impregnable against any amphibious assault."
 COL_defensa_desde_tierra_tt:0 "Place §YCoastal Forts§! in each coastal colombian states that are fully controlled by you."
 COL_modernizar_la_aviacion_naval:0 "Modernize the Naval Aviation"
 COL_modernizar_la_aviacion_naval_desc:0 "The air force is also responsible for safeguarding the skies of our oceans. However, this type of work requires specific aircraft models, and we need to have them first. We will dedicate a special section of our research to the design of this type of aircraft."
 COL_manufactura_blindada:0 "Armor Manufacturing"
 COL_manufactura_blindada_desc:0 "Let's face it, a cavalry charge has no chance against an armored offensive, nor a transport truck against a war tank. The time has come for our military industry to be flexible by adding armor production to our infantry."
 COL_topografia_militar:0 "Military Topography"
 COL_topografia_militar_desc:0 "Studying the terrain is also essential when planning an offense or a defensive line. Taking advantage of the vast and varied geography of our nation we will train our theorists to carry out specific logistical tasks if becomes necessary in the field of combat."
 COL_propiedad_social:0 "Common Property"
 COL_propiedad_social_desc:0 "We cannot continue to see property as a private form of economic exploitation. The State must recognize the social function that property has as an aid to the less favored, including those who own a lot and exploit little. We will not allow this margin of inequality to continue among the Colombian population."
 COL_legalizar_las_huelgas:0 "Legalize Strikes"
 COL_legalizar_las_huelgas_desc:0 "Something that is as common as strikes is still considered illegal in the country. It is nothing more than a vindication of workers' rights, and it is a despotic tactic to consider it a crime. The legislation must change immediately."
 COL_organizar_los_sindicatos:0 "Organize the Labor Unions"
 COL_organizar_los_sindicatos_desc:0 "The unions today are nothing more than disorganized labor circles without a clear list of demands and with internal disagreements. If the government steps in and helps organize them, we will get a large working class community that will maximize production by agreeing on their points of view."
 COL_priorizar_al_obrero:0 "Prioritize the Worker"
 COL_priorizar_al_obrero_desc:0 "There is a lot of talk about entrepreneurship and large industrialists, but the average wage earner is left aside. They have necessities, priorities and, most of all, rights too. The law have to be reformed for their benefit, or we will be ignoring a big problem in our society."
 COL_garantizar_el_acceso_universitario:0 "Guarantee University Access"
 COL_garantizar_el_acceso_universitario_desc:0 "It is not fair that only a handful of individuals are the ones who have access to higher education while the rest of the people are condemned to informal or poorly paid work. Public universities are the key to closing the Colombian educational gap."
 COL_cooperar_con_los_terratenientes:0 "Cooperate with Landowners"
 COL_cooperar_con_los_terratenientes_desc:0 "The large landowners are the ones who know what is best for the national economy. The State itself is incapable of managing everything as a material unit, but if it works as a private entity, it may be a sustainable model. We will establish agreements with the landowners so that the State works in accordance with them."
 COL_semilleros_de_investigacion:0 "Hotbeds of Research"
 COL_semilleros_de_investigacion_desc:0 "Commissioning state laboratories to develop all kinds of technology will only collapse the research program. The appropriate thing is to distribute the scientific loads in different Hotbeds to make the work more dynamic."
 COL_ferrocarriles_nacionales_de_colombia:0 "Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Colombia"
 COL_ferrocarriles_nacionales_de_colombia_desc:0 "The train is still a totally viable means of transport, but it has not received the attention it deserves. The national railways are abandoned and underinvested, in addition to the fact that the railway lines are almost non-existent. It is imperative to strengthen this sector before the country becomes a bunch  of isolated regions."
 COL_concesiones_estatales:0 "State Concessions"
 COL_concesiones_estatales_desc:0 "Handing over part of public needs to the private sector may sound bad at first for labor unions, but it is a feasible strategy to reduce state inefficiency and increase economic growth."
 COL_educacion_privada:0 "Private education"
 COL_educacion_privada_desc:0 "Overloading the public education system will not bring long-term benefits. Education is a service that can also be privatized and will be better provided by this sector."
 COL_expansion_industrial:0 "Industrial Expansion"
 COL_expansion_industrial_desc:0 "We must think ahead, in a Colombia with great internal industrial capacity, so we cannot concentrate all the industry in large urban areas. Expanding productive capacity to the periphery will allow decentralizing production and improving economic growth rates."
 COL_una_colombia_moderna:0 "A Modern Colombia"
 COL_una_colombia_moderna_desc:0 "This new Colombia was reborn renewed and self-sufficient. We will be a nation that does not depend on imports to survive, nor be left behind in technological development.

 COL_radiodifusora_nacional_desc:0 "Radio is a powerful tool, not only in terms of military intelligence, but also in the stability and credibility of the government. Using the existing Radiodifusora Nacional as a study center for this discipline will enhance our knowledge of this aspect."
 COL_emplear_el_petroleo:0 "Use our Oil"
 COL_emplear_el_petroleo_desc:0 "The country's large oil fields are not something to be ignored. We will develop the main oil extraction centers to enhance the refining of this resource along with the exploration of other deposits."
 COL_los_silos_del_norte:0 "The Northern Fuel Silos"
 COL_los_silos_del_norte_desc:0 "The large amount of oil that we extract means that we need places to store refined crude, so we will build large silos in the north of the country, where they are easily accessible for both trade and internal use."
 COL_procesamiento_de_caucho:0 "Rubber Processing"
 COL_procesamiento_de_caucho_desc:0 "Rubber derived from petroleum and natural rubber are indispensable in an industrialized society. We can take economic advantage of this need by processing our own rubber."
 COL_asegurar_los_recursos_minerales:0 "Securing Mineral Resources"
 COL_asegurar_los_recursos_minerales_desc:0 "If we continue to spend resources indiscriminately, we will run out of material for the military industry in the future. We need to plan our consumption and study new, more refined mineral extraction techniques."
 COL_etb:0 "ETB"
 COL_etb_desc:0 "The Bogotá Telecommunications Company (ETB) was a revolutionary bet that saw the light in 1884. Their cooperation and their knowledge of electronics will be of great use for state research projects."

 COL_desintegrar_la_apen:0 "Disintegrate the APEN"
 COL_desintegrar_la_apen_desc:0 "The National Economic Patriotic Action (APEN), made up of industrialists and large landowners, is a totally subversive movement. Not only does he intend to impose his personal interests on the government, but also to spread far-right thinking. This movement must no longer exist."
 COL_la_reforma_constitucional:0 "The Constitutional Reform"
 COL_la_reforma_constitucional_desc:0 "The time has come to make a significant change in Colombia. The State can no longer be understood as a “police” but rather as an entity at the service of the people and that guarantees rights and the fulfillment of duties. Thus, we must separate the state from the church, at least partially, to avoid its polarization."
 COL_la_reforma_constitucional_tt:0 "This path will keep the [GetLiberalName] in power."
 COL_oponerse_al_cambio:0 "Oppose Change"
 COL_oponerse_al_cambio_desc:0 "What are liberals really up to? Nothing more than to lead the nation to a state of chaos, without God or order, where the law of the strongest reigns. It is something unacceptable. In no way will we accept that misfortune. The reason must prevail."

 COL_nacionalizacion_del_credito:0 "Credit Nationalization"
 COL_nacionalizacion_del_credito_desc:0 "Economic protectionism is a good proposal, but it is not enough to safeguard the national industry. The system that privileges the oligarchs must be thoroughly attacked, nationalizing the credit sector and limiting monetary circulation."

 COL_integrar_el_banco_lopez_desc:0 "Pedro Aquilino López, father of President López Pumarejo, founded one of the most important banks in the country that bears his surname. However, the large capital that it holds, along with the issuance of legal currency, are not positive for the economy, since this work must be carried out by the State.

 COL_el_ejercito_popular:0 "The People's Army"
 COL_el_ejercito_popular_desc:0 "It is not fair that the army is a force at the service of the politicians of the day, it has to be an institution that protects all citizens equally.

 COL_tribuno_del_pueblo:0 "Tribune of the People"
 COL_tribuno_del_pueblo_desc:0 "Gaitán has won the affection of the people with his impeccable oratory, collecting their most basic interests that have been ignored by other politicians.

 COL_apoyar_a_la_republica:0 "Support the Republic"
 COL_apoyar_a_la_republica_desc:0 "Our last constitutional reform was inspired by the political charter of the Spanish Republic. Now, in this moment of crisis that they are going through, we have a moral duty to help them. We cannot let their legacy perish at the hands of those fascists!"
