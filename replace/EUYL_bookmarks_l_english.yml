 ARG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Thanks to the Great Depression, the Argentine economy has been in shambles for years now. Not only does Agustin Pedro Justo have to deal with a shattered economy, but also with a very distrusting population. Just 6 years back, a major coup occured, overthrowing the once president Hipólito Yrigoyen, which caused many people to distrust the military and the government as a whole.\n\nNow with the world heating up and global-scale war seeming imminent, it is impossible to tell just what will happen to Argentina and its political turmoil."
 ARG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After some rather questionable elections in 1937, Roberto Maria Ortiz has become president of the republic. the economic woes have mostly gone away and the people are slightly more trusting of the army. \n\nAll in all, everything seems to be going smoothly so far, however, many speculate this won't last long and at some point the military will once again intervene in the government. \n\nIf these speculations are true, then all we can do is pray none of this becomes bloody."
 CHL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the economic turmoil now out of the way, Chile can focus on more important parts of their nation, most notably their foreign policy. With the world quikcly burning up all around, will the bastion of Democracy in South America retain its crown or will it succumb to foreing influence."
 CHL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Chile now sees itself in the midst of global chaos. Europe is being devoured by fascism and radical ideologies. Over here at home, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela all gave up on the basic democratic principles. \n\nIt is up to us to show Latin America democracy and the benefits it brings to the nation. Por la libertad y propseridad!"
 URG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been 5 years since Gabriel Terra took power in Uruguay and established himself as dictator of the country. Multiple attempts have already been made to make him step down from power, but all have failed as of now. Due to these failed coups and other reasons, Terra has been imprisoning important people solely on the suspicion that they may be against him. \n\nWith the world heating up, one ponders what will occur with Uruguay."
 URG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The world is at its tipping point, and it is unknown as to what is going to happen. Many are speculating that Terra's final days as dictator are coming to a close and that we will once again get elections. Others are saying that he will continue as dictator until he dies. \n\nWhichever one occurs, let's just hope it's for the better."
 BOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Just one year after losing the Chaco to Paraguay in the Chaco War, Bolivia is in a state of near anarchy. The current president simply isn't able to maintain the nation any longer, and the military is planning a coup due to his incompetence. \n\nThe situation looks dark for Bolivia, and for now only the future will tell if they come out of this as a stronger power, or succumb to their own political turmoil."
 BOL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "With the world at the brink of a major war, Bolivia is stuck in a stalemate. Do they intervene and take the opportunity to expand, or do they stay neutral and stay out of wars. That is a question Germán will have to answer and fast if he wants to maintain the stability and sovereignty of his nation and people."
 COL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After being excluded for almost 50 years, the Liberals finally came to power in 1930. However, they received an industrially backward country, economically stagnant and shaken by a wave of bipartisan violence that rages daily. \n\nSince then Colombia has gone through a period of social reforms that have not gone unnoticed by the opposition. While López Pumarejo seeks to forge a neutral nation, others seem hell-bent on restoring Colombia's past greatness, albeit by force...."
 COL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The presidency of the Liberals has marked a before and after in Colombian history.The nation has developed rapidly and achieved social milestones that have revolutionized the concept of the state, but it still behind its regional neighbors.\n\nWith Eduardo Santos now at the helm, the country seems to be looking for a less radical course; slowing down reforms to avoid a social catastrophe is what he proposes with his program 'the Great Pause'."
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the Revolution still fresh in the minds of most Brazilians, the political and social climate in the country has not been doing great. Vargas is now forced to deal with a socially fragile nation, whose economy is still mostly rural and falling behind other nations. \n\nThe Paulistas still holding on to seperatist dreams, and opposing political parties growing in support. It's safe to say that the next few years for Brazil will be crucial for the country."
 BRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The process of establishing the Estado Novo was a long and brutal one. Many parties were forcefully shut down, and people's voices had to be censored in order for Vargas to reach the status of a dictatorship. \n\nWith the world heating up as tensions  between the Allies and the Axis continue to rise, Vargas's Brazil is forced to decide between siding with either side, or maintaing neutrality. What will Brazil do?"
 PAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Not even a year has passed since the conclusion of the Chaco War. We were thankfully victorious, however, the war still affected greatly our country, as both our army and politics are in a fragile state due to the resources spent on the war. We'll need to recover and geet back up on our feet before any country takes advantage of our fragile situation."
 PAR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "While Paraguay's current situation has improved significantly compared to just 3 years ago. There's still no denying that the current situation is far from ideal. The current Liberal rule has been heavily criticized by many, and the promises that have been done prior to assuming power have not been accomplished. \n\nWill Paraguay be able to pull through and prevail?"

 PRU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever since the War of the Pacific, Peru has been rendered a husk of its former self. Peru's army is a laughing stock, the navy was destroyed by the Chileans, and they don't even have an airforce! In addition, the Great Depression's wrath has found its way to even Peru, though, not as severely as other nations.\n\nÓscar Benavides has a lot of things to do—and not a lot of time—as many of our neighbors are eyeing our lands as the world gets more tense..."
 PRU_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Thanks to Óscar, many of the issues that plague Peru have begun to heal. With the question of our form of government settled, our nation has stabilized politically. Peru's army has begun to modernize with the purchases of foreign weaponry, and has thus gotten stronger.\n\nWith many burdens lifted from Peru's shoulders and as the world devolves into yet another war, Peru—saved from the grasps of extremism by the Constituent Assembly—is now left with one question; "What do we do now?""
